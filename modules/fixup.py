"""
    Module to fix benchmark identifying information for past iterations of
    SMT-COMP.
    Sometimes benchmarks were moved or renamed.  We try to search for
    benchmarks using `guess_benchmark_id`.  However, this is sometimes not
    enough.  Here are some hard coded rules for these cases.
    Note that some benchmarks were also removed for non-compliance.
